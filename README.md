# Speedrun Ethereum - Challenge 3: Dice Game


## 📖 Introduction
This repository contains my solution for **Challenge 3: Dice Game** from the Speedrun Ethereum curriculum.

The goal of this challenge is to build a decentralized dice game application (`DiceGame.sol`) that allows users to roll a dice and win rewards based on the outcome. The smart contract includes the following functionality:

- **Roll Dice**: Users can call a `rollDice()` function to roll a dice by sending ETH.
- **Win Rewards**: If the dice roll results in a 1, the user wins the reward.
- **Rigged Roll**: A separate contract (`RiggedRoll.sol`) is used to demonstrate vulnerabilities in the dice game.

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- **Framework**: Scaffold-ETH 2
- **Smart Contract**: Solidity
- **Frontend**: Next.js, RainbowKit, Tailwind CSS
- **Environment**: Hardhat (Localhost)

---

## 🛠 Prerequisites
Before running this project, ensure your machine meets the following requirements:

- **Node.js**: Version >= 18.17 (LTS recommended)
- **Yarn**: v1 or v2+ (Package manager)
- **Git**: Version control system

To verify your installations, run:

```bash
node -v
yarn -v
git --version
```

---

## 🚀 Installation & Setup Guide
This project uses Scaffold-ETH 2, which requires running three separate terminals to simulate the blockchain environment, deploy contracts, and host the frontend.

### Step 1: Clone the Repository
Open your terminal and clone the project code:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/LightyWind22/challenge-3-dice-game.git
cd challenge-3-dice-game
```

### Step 2: Install Dependencies
Install all necessary node modules for both the Hardhat backend and the Next.js frontend:

```bash
yarn install
```

---

## 🏃‍♂️ How to Run (3-Terminal Workflow)
Please follow these steps in order. You will need three separate terminal windows/tabs open.

### Terminal 1: Start the Local Blockchain
This command starts a local Ethereum network (Hardhat network) on your machine. Keep this terminal running.

```bash
yarn chain
```

### Terminal 2: Deploy Smart Contracts
Open a second terminal. This command deploys your `DiceGame.sol` and `RiggedRoll.sol` to the local network created in Terminal 1.

```bash
yarn deploy
```

> **Note**: If you modify the smart contract code later, you must run `yarn deploy` again.

### Terminal 3: Start the Frontend
Open a third terminal. This command starts the React/Next.js application.

```bash
yarn start
```

Once started, open your web browser and navigate to: [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

### Terminal 4: Run Tests
Open a fourth terminal. This command runs the tests for the Dice Game smart contracts.

```bash
yarn test
```

> **Note**: This will execute the Hardhat tests with gas reporting enabled.

## 🧪 How to Test the Functionality
Once the application is running at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000), follow these steps to verify the solution:

1. **Connect Wallet**:
   - Click the "Connect Wallet" button in the top right.
   - Use the "Burner Wallet" (a temporary local wallet) generated by the app.

2. **Get Test Funds**:
   - Click the "Faucet" button (top right) or the generic faucet icon to grab some test ETH on the localhost network.

3. **Roll Dice**:
   - Enter an amount of ETH (e.g., `0.1`) in the UI input box.
   - Click the **Roll Dice** button.
   - **Verification**: You should see the dice roll result and a "RollDice" event appear in the history.

4. **Test Rigged Roll**:
   - Deploy the `RiggedRoll.sol` contract and interact with it to exploit the dice game.
   - **Verification**: Observe the vulnerability in the dice game logic.
